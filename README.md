## Arhitecture

- App build in React.js
- State management library is not being used in app
- I used bootstrap (no need to reinvent the wheel).
- Race winners are listed onload

- When user clicks the header of list of the relevant years races winners list hides
- When user clicks another race winner, other list of race list close and relevant one display,
